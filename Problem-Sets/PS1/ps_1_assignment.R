This is the README for problem set 1. 
In class, Preceptor will walk you through the process 
of creating a new file, ps_1.Rmd, knitting it into ps_1.html, 
committing/pushing both to the GitHub repo (which is personal to you) 
which was created for this assignment by TF Alyssa using GitHub Classroom.
